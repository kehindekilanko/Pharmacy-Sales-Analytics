Pharmacy businesses often grow revenue without improving profitability. This analysis focuses on identifying:
Which countries and pharmacy locations generate the most revenue and profit
Whether higher sales volume translates into higher profitability
How pharmacy type and store size impact performance
Which product categories and brands deliver the highest margins
The effect of promotions and generic products on revenue

Recommendations

Scale medium-sized urban pharmacies in high-performing regions

Increase focus on high-margin Wellness and Personal Care products

Replicate high-margin country strategies (e.g., Belgium and Austria) in larger markets

Reduce reliance on promotions and strengthen brand-led pricing strategies

Track profit per product, not just units sold

Key Takeaway

Sustainable growth comes from optimizing store formats and product mix, not just increasing sales volume.
